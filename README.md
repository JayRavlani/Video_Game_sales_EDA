# Sales Analysis of Video Game

Welcome to the Video Game Sales Analysis repository! This repository contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) on video game sales data. Through this analysis, we aim to gain insights into trends, patterns, and factors influencing video game sales across different platforms, genres, and regions.

## Dataset

The analysis is based on a dataset of video game sales, which includes information such as:

- Title of the game
- Platform (e.g., PlayStation, Xbox, PC)
- Genre (e.g., Action, Sports, Role-Playing)
- Year of release
- Publisher
- Global sales figures

The dataset used for this analysis can be found in the repository. Detailed descriptions of the columns and data sources are provided in the ipynb file.
